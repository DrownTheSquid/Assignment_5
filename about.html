      <div class="history">
      At the ripe year of 1789, our founder Bubb L. Rapp decided to combine his love for the culinary arts and fascination with popping things.  He invented the bubble wrap to keep his hands busy during emotional breakdowns, and decided to name it after himself.  He opened this cafe up to the public in 1810 after completing  his menu.  For 208 years we have served everyone the American classics their great-great-great grandmother would eat in her youth.  Join us in celebrating another 208 years with us as we continue on with serving packing material with your food.
